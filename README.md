# Pixiv Novel Saver

A script to save your loved novels to local disk.

**Thanks to the authors for their creativity! And be sure to respect the author's work!**

**This tool is designed to help save our favorite novels locally so that they can be read on a variety of devices. Please NEVER distribute the novels until you have permission from the author.**

## Usage:

Install dependents:

```
GNU Bash
cURL
jq
```

Create a `pixiv-config` file.

Login your account on browser, and get pixiv cookie `PHPSESSID` and add it to `pixiv-config`. set `USER_ID` to your pixiv user id. It likes

```
COOKIE="PHPSESSID=XXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;"
USER_ID="<Your user id>"
```

Run the script

```
$ ./novel.sh -c -m
```

`-c` or `--lazy-text-count` option enables "text count" lazy mode. For this example, it will avoid repeated saves after the second time.  But in this example it's a little dangerous, because the novel may have been updated, and there is no way to see the last update time of the novel before getting the full novel for this source type (bookmarks). However, there are still some ways to allow roughly guessing whether the novel has been updated, such as the number of words, but this is not 100% accurate. For more information, please refer to "Lazy mode" section.

`-m` or `--save-my-bookmarks` option make program to save all your bookmarked novels.

To save all novels by an author, you can use `-A <ID>` or `--save-author <ID>`. (Can be specified multiple times)

To save all novels from a series, you can use `-s <ID>` or `--save-series <ID>`. (Can be specified multiple times)

To save novels by it ID, you can use `-a <ID>` or `--save-novel <ID>`. (Can be specified multiple times)

Some other options are useful, such as `-d, --no-series`, `-E, --ignore-empty`, `-w, --window-size`, etc.

For more infomation, run

```
$ ./novel.sh -h
```

You can also set default options in `pixiv-config`, but you need to read source code to find which you want...

## Lazy mode

We support different levels of lazy mode for different sources. There are three types. Lazy mode will avoid repeated saves after the second time.

Mode|Source|Description
----------|------------------|---------
always (full supported)|`-s, --save-series`|For this source, Pixiv gives us "update time" before getting full content of novel. So lazy mode is always on. Novels will be updated only when the author updates their novel. It will avoid repeated saves after the second time. It's not dangerous.
text count|`-m, --save-my-bookmarks` and `-A, --save-author`|For this source, Pixiv does NOT give us "update time" before getting full content of novel. However, there are still some ways to allow roughly guessing whether the novel has been updated, such as the number of words, but this is not 100% accurate. `-c` or `--lazy-text-count` option enables "text count" Lazy Mode. It's a little dangerous.
never (not supported)|`-a, --save-novel`|For this source, lazy mode is impossible.

To disable all lazy modes unconditionally, you can use specify `-u` or `--disable-lazy-mode` option. But usually not needed.

And we recommend that you generally use the option `-c` to enable the "text count" lazy mode to reduce network traffic and Pixiv server stress.

## Flags

You may have noticed the uppercase letters before each novel in the output, which is a set of flags. Here is a brief introduction to them.

- `N` means it is a novel. It should be displayed always.

- `S` means the novel is in a series. To disable series support, specify `-d` or `--no-series`.

- `T` Timestamp available. Pixiv gives us "update time" before getting full content of novel and lazy mode is always on.

- `I` on Lazy mode, this novel have been ignored.

## Notice

0.2.x version is not compatible with 0.1.x version. So in order to avoid trouble, the default save location has also changed.
